PathoGenius aims to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and development by addressing several major challenges that impact the Indian and Global Healthcare systems. 
-
These challenges include:

- Mutations and antimicrobial resistance
- Conservation of drug and target structures
- Limited access to crucial structural information.

One of the significant challenges in the healthcare landscape is mutations in pathogens, which lead to antimicrobial resistance and render existing antibiotics ineffective. This poses a global health threat and is particularly concerning in India, where drug-resistant infections, like neonatal sepsis, contribute to higher mortality rates. Moreover, the mutations observed in the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly influenced its course.

To ensure drug effectiveness, it is vital to maintain the structural integrity of drugs and their target molecules, even in the face of mutations. Structural changes resulting from mutations can impact how drugs bind to their targets, reducing treatment efficacy. 

In a country like India, where tuberculosis remains a major health issue, preserving the structure of anti-tubercular drugs is of utmost importance. Globally, the challenge of conserving the structure of drug and target molecules significantly affects the development of treatments for various diseases, leading to prolonged research timelines.

Furthermore, limited access to accurate 2D and 3D structural information of drugs and targets hampers the progress of drug discovery efforts. Access to such critical data is essential for researchers to make informed decisions and accelerate the development of new antibiotics, effectively combating the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.
